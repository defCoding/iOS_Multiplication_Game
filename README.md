# iOS_Multiplication_Game
A basic iOS game that prompts you with random multiplication problems (up to two digit multiplication). Keeps track of how many correct
and incorrect you've gotten in that session.

## Context
I had just taken an introductory iOS App Development class, and wanted to try my hand at a simple project to see what I could make. There is definitely a lot I still don't understand about iOS development, but I'm glad I tried this out.

## How to Run
You will have to open the project in XCode, and download the app on your Apple device via XCode.
